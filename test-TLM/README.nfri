* An example project of TLM based co-simulation

* ControlledMass.mo : A openmodelica model of 1-D coupled mass system, in which 
two individual masses are linked by a TLM element (a spring + a parasitic mass).
This system is driven by an external force controlled by a proportional signal
to the amount of error between the postion of second mass and the control value 
(sinusoidal wave). 


* ControlledMassOMCs.xml : A composite model to implemenet a TLM based co-simualation
of two separated mass systems which are indepenedant openmodelica models (Driver.mo and Load.mo)

* ControlledMassFMUs.xml : The same composite model, but its co-simulation consists of 
two FMUs (Driver.fmu and Load.fmu) which are exported by openmodelica from the abovementioned
*.mo models
